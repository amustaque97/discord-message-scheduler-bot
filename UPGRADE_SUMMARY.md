# Upgrade and Fix Summary

## Date: October 19, 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes all changes made to upgrade the Discord Message Scheduler Bot to use the latest Appwrite SDK and fix all issues in the codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Dependency Upgrades** ✅

#### requirements.txt

- **Appwrite SDK**: Upgraded from `5.0.1` → `13.4.1` (latest stable version)
- **discord.py**: Upgraded from `2.3.2` → `2.6.4` (latest stable version, Python 3.13 compatible)
- **python-dotenv**: Updated from `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`
- **python-dateutil**: Updated from `2.8.2` → `2.9.0`
- **pytz**: Updated from `2024.1` → `2024.2`

**Rationale**: The Appwrite SDK had a major version upgrade from v5 to v13, introducing breaking API changes. Discord.py was upgraded to 2.6.4 for Python 3.13 compatibility (includes `audioop-lts` package). All dependencies were updated to their latest stable versions for security patches and new features.

---

### 2. **Appwrite SDK API Compatibility Fixes** ✅

#### appwrite_client.py

**Issue**: In Appwrite SDK 13.x, the `Query.equal()` method now requires values to be passed as a list/array instead of a single value.

**Changes Made**:

- Line ~140: Updated `Query.equal('discord_user_id', discord_user_id)` → `Query.equal('discord_user_id', [discord_user_id])`
- Line ~145: Updated `Query.equal('status', status)` → `Query.equal('status', [status])`
- Line ~168: Updated `Query.equal('status', 'pending')` → `Query.equal('status', ['pending'])`
- Line ~323: Updated `Query.equal('discord_user_id', discord_user_id)` → `Query.equal('discord_user_id', [discord_user_id])`
- Line ~489: Updated `Query.equal('scheduled_message_id', scheduled_message_id)` → `Query.equal('scheduled_message_id', [scheduled_message_id])`

**Impact**: These changes ensure compatibility with the new Query API in SDK 13.x while maintaining the same functionality.

---

### 3. **Setup Script Updates** ✅

#### setup_appwrite.py

**Changes Made**:

- Updated header documentation to reflect SDK 13.x compatibility (removed v5.0.1 specific workarounds)
- Removed obsolete comments about "request cannot have request body" error
- Updated `create_database()` function documentation to remove SDK 5.0.1 workaround references
- Updated `collection_exists()` function documentation to remove workaround references

**Rationale**: The SDK 13.x version has fixed the issues that required workarounds in v5, so the code is now cleaner and more straightforward.

---

### 4. **Import Path Fixes** ✅

#### bot.py

**Issue**: The import statement referenced `utility_commands` but the actual filename is `utils_commands.py`.

**Change Made**:

- Line ~166: Updated `from commands import schedule_commands, management_commands, utility_commands`
  → `from commands import schedule_commands, management_commands, utils_commands`
- Line ~172: Updated reference from `utility_commands.UtilityCommands(bot)` → `utils_commands.UtilityCommands(bot)`

**Impact**: Fixes the import error that would have prevented the bot from starting.

---

### 5. **Python 3.13 Compatibility Fix** ✅

#### Issue: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'audioop'`

**Problem**: Python 3.13 removed the `audioop` module, which discord.py 2.4.0 and earlier versions depend on for audio functionality.

**Solution**: Upgraded discord.py from `2.4.0` → `2.6.4`

**Details**:

- Discord.py 2.6.4 includes `audioop-lts` as a dependency
- `audioop-lts` provides the missing `audioop` module for Python 3.13+
- This is a drop-in replacement with no code changes required

**Impact**: The bot now runs correctly on Python 3.13.x without import errors.

---

## Breaking Changes in Appwrite SDK 13.x

### Query API Changes

The most significant change is in the Query builder methods:

**Old (SDK 5.x)**:

```python
Query.equal('field_name', 'value')
Query.equal('status', 'pending')
```

**New (SDK 13.x)**:

```python
Query.equal('field_name', ['value'])
Query.equal('status', ['pending'])
```

All query equality checks now require the value(s) to be passed as a list, even for single values.

### Other SDK Improvements

- Better error handling and exception messages
- Improved type hints and documentation
- Performance optimizations
- Bug fixes from SDK versions 6.x through 13.x

---

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Install updated dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

### 2. Database Setup

```bash
# Run the setup script to ensure database schema is correct
python setup_appwrite.py
```

### 3. Configuration

- Verify `.env` file has all required variables (reference `.env.example`)
- Ensure Appwrite endpoint, project ID, and API key are correct

### 4. Bot Testing

```bash
# Start the bot
python bot.py
```

### 5. Functional Tests

- Test scheduling a message to a channel: `/schedule_message`
- Test scheduling a DM: `/schedule_dm`
- Test listing scheduled messages: `/list_scheduled`
- Test canceling a message: `/cancel_scheduled`
- Test editing a message: `/edit_scheduled`
- Test user preferences: `/set_timezone`, `/preferences`
- Verify the scheduler service processes pending messages correctly
- Check execution logs are created properly

## Compatibility Notes

### Python Version

- Minimum: Python 3.9
- Recommended: Python 3.10 or higher
- **Tested with: Python 3.13.7** ✅
- **Note**: Python 3.13+ requires discord.py 2.6+ due to `audioop` module removal

### Appwrite

- Minimum: Appwrite 1.4+
- Tested with: Appwrite Cloud (latest)
- SDK: 13.4.1

### Discord

- discord.py: 2.6.4 (Python 3.13 compatible)
- Requires Discord Bot with proper intents enabled:
  - Message Content Intent
  - Server Members Intent (optional)
